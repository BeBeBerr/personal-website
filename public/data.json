Using image processing, I can precisely detect the position of the front point and the end point of a car in the image frame. As the cameras are calibrated, those positions can be converted into the world frame. Thus the 3D position and orientation of a given car can be calculated.\nTo control the mini-car through the Wi-Fi network, we replace the built-in remote controller with Raspberry-Pi. PWM waves are generated and control the servo motor and the DC motor. The 4 computers share information through the Ethernet network, and each of them has a separate Wi-Fi network card and acts as a small base station. To make the mini-car able to roam across different base stations, the network card on the mini-car works in a connectionless way.\nThe lane-keeping controller is a PID controller. Given the position and status of a mini-car, we can calculate a virtual target position. As the car is moving, the virtual target is also moving. So, the car can run along the lane stably.\nWe use ROS as our inter-computers communication framework. As all the information is transmitting through ROS, we use Rviz to visualize the status of the system, which is pretty helpful for debugging.\nI designed and implemented the entire software system, as well as part of the hardware system."

To get a better performance, PCA is used to reduce the dimension. \nIn order to detect the position of the hand, we use 3 different sizes of sliding windows to scan the image. Then, a heat-map is generated and the \"hottest\" location is most likely represent hand.\nThe sub-image is then fed into the next classifier to classify gestures. 5 different gestures can be recognized, including open-hand, thumb-up, and so on. As you can see, the gesture recognizer is able to tell both the position and the gesture class in a relatively complicated image.\nInstead of download training sets from the Internet, we collect hundreds of images by ourselves."
